## Installation

RandomizeId works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'randomize_id'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install randomize_id

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'randomize_id', github: 'jonhue/randomize_id'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g randomize_id

---

## Usage

Unless you [configured](#configuration) RandomizeId to automatically randomize IDs for all ActiveRecord objects, you have to add the following to every model whose records should have random Ids:

```ruby
include RandomizeId
```

That's it!

---

## Configuration

You can configure RandomizeId by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/randomize_id.rb`:

```ruby
RandomizeId.configure do |config|
    config.auto = false
end
```

* `auto` Automaitcally randomize IDs of all ActiveRecord objects. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.
